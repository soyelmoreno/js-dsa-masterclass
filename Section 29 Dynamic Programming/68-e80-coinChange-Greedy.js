Exercise 80.

Coin Change - Greedy Algorithm

Important note: In this coding exercise, we are using a greedy approach to the
coin change problem, not Dynamic Programming. Please keep in mind that a greedy
approach might not work well with all coin systems and denominations. If we need
an approach that always yields the true minimum coin count for any set of
denominations, we would use a Dynamic Programming approach, which we will
implement in the next coding exercise called: "Dynamic Programming â€“ Coin
Change". In comparison to the greedy approach, that coding exercise focuses on a
Dynamic Programming solution that systematically finds an optimal result for all
coin sets.

But first, let's try the Coin Change - Greedy Algorithm approach:

Write a function minCoinChange that takes two arguments: an array of coin
denominations (coins) and a target amount number (amount). The provided array of
coins is sorted in ascending order, starting from the smallest coin denomination
to the largest.

Your task is to return an array representing the minimum number of coins needed
to make the given amount. The result should be an array of the actual coins
used, not their count or sum. To achieve this, you should start by considering
the largest denominations first and use them as much as possible before moving
to smaller denominations. As a consequence of this, the result array should be
sorted in descending order, starting from the largest coin denomination to the
smallest.

function minCoinChange(coins, amount) {
  const result = [];
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = coins.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
    const coin = coins[i];
    while (amount - coin >= sum) {
      sum += coin;
      result.push(coin);
    }
  }
  return result;
}

minCoinChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 11); // --> [5, 5, 1]
minCoinChange([5, 10, 15, 20, 25], 85); // --> [25, 25, 25, 10]
minCoinChange([1, 5, 6, 9], 11); // --> [9, 1, 1]
